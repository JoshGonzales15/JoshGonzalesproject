    <h2> Why Did I picked japan?</h2>
    <p1> Japan is a place, that i've been dreaming of going to, because japan is one of the best known countries in the world </p1>
    <p2> As they have one of the most unique culture, they all have the respect of a human being, and they also have the best spots </p2>
    <p3> that you can ever visit which is the tokyo, kyoto and shibuya. And in my perspective that i can live in my fullest potential</p3>
    <p4> Of my life in japan, as i know that someday if i have a family, i know that i can give them the very best life in japan. </p4>
    <h2>Read Me</h2>
